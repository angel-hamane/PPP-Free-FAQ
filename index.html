  <h2>Legal / Education Clarification</h2>
  <details>
    <summary>What’s the difference between probate and probate litigation?</summary>
    <p>General probate handles administration of estates (distributing assets, paying debts). Probate litigation involves legal disputes—such as contesting a trust or will—brought before the court for resolution.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What happens if I miss the statute of limitations deadline?</summary>
    <p>Generally, the court will not allow you to file after the deadline. This is why learning and acting within the statute of limitations is critical. For specifics, consult an attorney.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Why is “standing” important?</summary>
    <p>Standing determines who has the legal right to bring a case. If you don’t meet the requirements, the court will dismiss your petition.</p>
